\usage{
alignTime(datList, alignCell, alignPoint = 1, align_t = 0, alignBlot = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{datList}{list of CD-like dataFrames}

\item{alignCell}{the cell used to find common time point to align}

\item{alignPoint}{a 0 to 1 ratio number showing what ratio of the alignCell life to align together (1 means the end, 0 means the start)}

\item{align_t}{the time of the \code{alignCell} at \code{alignPoint} after alignment, if the input is \code{"mean"} the align time will be the mean value of \code{alignPoint} across all embryos}

\item{alignBlot}{whether and method to align the blot values together default \code{FALSE} for not align, "mean" for aligning the mean values together (by addition/subtraction)}
}
\value{
modified list of CD-like dataFrames
}
\description{
'align' the cell time of a list of CD-like dataFrame by a specific cell stage
so that there is a "common" reference point (like common start time of lineage)
}
\examples{
`alignTime(datList, alignCell="MSa", alignPoint = 100, alignTime = "mean", alignBlot = "no")`
to have every CD-like dataFrame have the end time of MSa cell equals the mean end time of MSa cell
all other cell time points will be moved in parallel
}
