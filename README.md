# embryo_lineage_analysis_R

R based package to analyze and visualize embryo lineage after the cell
data are extracted from 3D movies in StarryNite/Acetree. Allowable input data 
formats are StarryNite ".zip" files or "CD" .csv files where:

- each table represent one embryo
- the first row contains column names
- each row represents one cell at a specific time point, with required columns:
  - `time`: imaging time this cell read is created
  - `cell`: cell name
  - `x`: x position
  - `y`
  - `z`
  - `blot`: reporter expression

Example input files of each format are available in the sample_data folder

`LineageProcessing.R` contains functions to process one single embryo
entity, and slices from embryo entities, which are the dependencies of
other codes. Including functions `CD_Processing.R` are functions to work
with a directory of several embryo data tables. Including fucntions to
load data tables, retrieve specific cells and lineages data from
multiple embryos, and operations that are only possible with multiple
embryos (e.g. depth correction) `drawEmb.R` contains functions that plot
all nucleus in an embryo in 3D `tree_plots.R` plots lineage trees 
with customizable styles

## Installation
Please ensure the package and its dependencies are installed **BEFORE** installing LIVE_tools

### 1. Install Dependencies

This package depends on several CRAN and Bioconductor packages.  
You can install all dependencies automatically using the following commands:

#### Install CRAN dependencies
```{r}
cran_deps <- c(
  "data.table", "dplyr", "plotly", "reticulate", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "viridis" 
) # <-- replace with actual CRAN dependencies from DESCRIPTION
cran_missing <- setdiff(cran_deps, rownames(installed.packages()))
if (length(cran_missing)) {
  install.packages(cran_missing)
}
```
#### Install Bioconductor dependencies
```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager") #first, make sure Bioconductor package manager is present

bioc_deps <- c(
  "ggtree" #Bioconductor packages to install
)
bioc_missing <- setdiff(bioc_deps, rownames(installed.packages())) #check missing and install
if (length(bioc_missing)) {
  BiocManager::install(bioc_missing)
}
```
### Install LIVEtools

Simplest way is to use install_github (requires the devtools library)
```{r}
devtools::install_github("johnmurraylab/LIVE_tools")
library(LIVEtools)
```

### Alternative local download install:
Download LIVEtools release package (with file name `LIVEtools_?.?.?.????.tar.gz` where the `?`s are version numbers) from <a href="https://github.com/johnmurraylab/LIVE_tools/releases">**Releases**]</a> on github repository

Then run the following command
```{r}
#replace package name with the actual release file name you downloaded
install.packages("full/path/to/tar.gz/file", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

## Modules
### LineageProcessing
functions to process one single embryo entity, and slices from embryo entities, which are the dependencies of other codes. 

### CD_Processing
functions to work with a directory of several embryo data tables. Including functions to load data tables, retrieve specific cells and lineages data from multiple embryos, and operations that are only possible with multiple embryos (e.g. depth correction)

### drawEmb
functions that plot all nucleus in an embryo in 3D

#### Configuring Python
The `saveEmbImg` function uses the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package
to interface with a Python instance with "kaleido" and "plotly" installed, with compatible versions. 

Before loading the package, you should tell reticulate which Python to use. 
For example:

```r
# Use a conda environment
reticulate::use_condaenv("myenv", required = TRUE)

# Or set RETICULATE_PYTHON in your .Rprofile
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = "/path/to/python")
```

### tree_plots
This package requires a non-CRAN package ggtree that won't be automatically installed
To install ggtree (offered by bioconductor):
```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("ggtree")

```
